  'Hi! I cook very often and would love any cookware. In particular, I could use a microplane, baking sheet/pan, an electric/hand whisk, a baking cooling rack, measuring cups (dry/liquid/cup are fine), or a metal colander! I have been meaning to get a microwavable eye mask for when I sleep, so that would be lovely too. I also spend a lot of time on my laptop so I would appreciate a laptop stand (macbook 14 inch) or a keyboard wrist rest. Besides that, I like floral candles and in terms of food, love lifesaver gummies, sour patch watermelon candies, and tea packs. If any of those are hard, a nintendo eshop card can be found pretty much anywhere and would be totally cool as well! Hope that is helpful and I appreciate it so much! Thank you!',
  'I love to watch movies and tv ( a lot of sitcoms like friends, new girl, schitts creek, etc), I love to yap, I love arts and crafts, and I love reading mystery or romance novels. I love eating chips, especially jalapeno or spicy ones,  sour punch straw bites, and chocolate covered fruits.',

  'In my free time during the winter, I like going snowboarding as much as possible! Maybe a pair of warm socks or something like that would be great. In terms of food and treats, gift cards for any places like in n out, chick-fil-a, pizza places, smoothie places, etc is another option!',

I like to play video games, watch sports, read, and cook. If you are having figuring out a gift, I also love Takis and regular snacks as well. I appreciate a bunch of snacks the same way I appreciate anything else because its the giving that matters, not the gift!',
